# Collaborative Document Management Backend

## Description
This project is a robust backend system for managing documents, built with FastAPI and Python. It provides a RESTful API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting documents, as well as searching through document content and metadata.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for documents
- Search functionality across document titles and content
- Document versioning
- Metadata management for documents
- Efficient file storage system for document content and metadata
- RESTful API design
- Built with FastAPI for high performance and easy-to-use async capabilities

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
